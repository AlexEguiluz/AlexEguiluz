### Hi, I am Alexandra Eguiluz :wave:
I am a Peruvian artist, web developer and educator based in Paris since 2013.

### What I am working on right now ðŸ‘€

At this moment I am in the middle of a web development training at [Social Builder](https://socialbuilder.org/formation-developpeuse-web/) in partnership with WebForce3. 

I am currently teacher in the department of Fine Arts and Communication Design at [Paris College of Art](https://www.paris.edu/) and I am part of [Teaching to Transgress Toolbox](http://ttttoolbox.net/r/About.md), a collective research and study programme on critical pedagogy using artistic tools based on peer-learning and collective research. At the present time I am producing a [digital archive](https://loasis.site/) within the framework of a project called Fragments of Repair, a collective study program that is organized by BAK with the artist Kader Attia. I am in charge of developing the website, producing and managing its content.

### Teaching and Web ðŸ’»

I am in the search for alternative ways of education and communication that challenge the rigid systems in which we are often involved. As part of this inquiry, I spent some time teaching in the mountains of Peru in the institute Pukllasunchis. In this institution, alternative and multicultural education is key and experience and context are important pedagogical tools. Together with the students, we developed research projects and materialized these investigations through video, installation and performance. During my stay in Cusco, I assisted [Pukllasunchis](https://pukllasunchis.org/iesp-pukllasunchis) in the production of new audiovisual material and the management of their web and social media presence.

### Art ðŸ’¥

My artistic practice nourishes the same interest in questioning the system in which we live and seek to generate social consciousness. I sincerely believe that the artist is constantly growing and learning through experience and time, thinking critically, thinking outside the box and considering art to be constantly evolving. My great challenge is to involve the the spectator through sensory experiences. From this initiative, I started producing experimental videos and installations with the aim of capturing the immediacy of life, the spontaneity and naturalness of the interpretation of characters and events.
